# Assignment_AA_Game
 
 
# What I did? #
I used unity to recreate the AA Game. I added an intro, instructions, mainlevel, end scenes. I followed Brackeys youtube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKBUIaZcv3U.  

# Modifications
I added an inputfield so the player can input their name, slider for the speed of the game, panel to show the name, score, high score, speed, and rounds played. 

# Problems
I could not get the inputfield for the player name to work. I also could not get to make a new repository for the AA game.
